# ParamX

Create parameters wordlist from Javascript files for these purposes:

- Use as a wordlist for [Arjun](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun)
- Use as a wordlist for [x8](https://github.com/Sh1Yo/x8)

You can use the wordlist to find for example hidden parameters.

## Patterns

There are some regex patterns in [utils.patterns.py](utils/patterns.py) for extracting function names and variable names to use in other tools.
